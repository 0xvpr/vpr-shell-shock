- [ ] Cross-Platform Compatibility
      Extend Support Beyond Windows: Currently, the library is tailored for Windows environments. Expanding its capabilities to include support for other operating systems (like Linux or macOS) could increase its utility. This could involve abstracting OS-specific functionalities and implementing equivalent mechanisms for other systems.

- [ ] Error Handling and Logging
      Enhanced Error Handling: The library could benefit from more robust error handling mechanisms. This includes checking return values of system calls and providing fallbacks or meaningful error messages when operations fail.
      Logging Capabilities: Introducing logging functionalities (with different verbosity levels) can help users understand what the library is doing at any moment, especially when troubleshooting or debugging.

- [ ] Documentation and Examples
      Comprehensive Documentation: While the library appears to be well-structured, comprehensive documentation covering its design, intended use cases, function descriptions, and limitations would be invaluable. This could also include best practices for security and usage.
      Usage Examples and Tutorials: Providing a set of detailed examples or tutorials demonstrating how to use the library in various scenarios could lower the entry barrier for new users and showcase its capabilities.

- [ ] Security Enhancements
      Security Audits and Reviews: Subjecting the library to security audits or code reviews can identify potential vulnerabilities or logic errors that could be exploited. Engaging with the security community for this purpose could also enhance its credibility and reliability.
      Safe Programming Practices: Although the nature of shellcode generation inherently involves dealing with low-level programming constructs, adopting safe programming practices where possible (such as avoiding potential buffer overflows or memory leaks) can improve the library's security posture.
 
- [ ] Modularity and Extensibility
      Plugin Architecture for Extensibility: Implementing a plugin architecture could allow users to extend the library's functionality without modifying its core. This could be particularly useful for adding new features, such as support for additional cryptographic algorithms or integration with other tools.
      Refactoring for Modularity: Refactoring the code to enhance modularity could make it easier to maintain, understand, and extend. This involves organizing the code into more discrete, logical components with well-defined interfaces.
   
- [ ] Testing and Validation
      Unit and Integration Testing: Developing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests can ensure the library's components work as intended individually and when combined. Automated testing can also facilitate the identification of regressions or bugs introduced by new changes.
      Performance Benchmarks: Establishing performance benchmarks could help identify potential efficiency improvements, especially important for time-sensitive applications of shellcode.
